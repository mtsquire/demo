I wanted a mood that felt personal and intimate. This was then highlighted by the animation. I wanted this to feel innocent, primitive and bold and I felt the nature of doing this animation for real as camera less animation (a technique pioneered by the incredible Norman McLaren) would capture an insight and honesty that matches the emotion of the track. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAll animation done by hand directly onto 35mm film. BTS pics below.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nProcess<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe began by shooting on 35mm film. We almost had an entirely female crew too. Which was great.  Why does this not happen more please!? <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe film was then scanned and made digital so we could edit it. The day to night timelapse was fun to capture too. I wanted a 7 second timelapse which meant I needed 175 frames. With the help of the awesome DP Katie Swain who designed the lighting to replicate that feeling of daylight changing to nighttime. While nearly all the crew plus the commissioner James Hackett were allocated control over different lights to gradually dim down and up over the 3 minutes we took to execute this effect. We shot 1 frame per sec and ended with 180 frames. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnce edited I then worked with an animator to create a digital animatic to give us an indication of what some of the animation might look like on the footage. Thanks Daniel Murtha! <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe then graded the film and then had the film reprinted back on to 35mm negs which we sent to our animator. Enter the very talented and highly skilled, Em Cooper.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nI'm not sure anything could have prepared us for the delicate execution of painting directly on to film!  Experienced as she is she had still never painted directly on to film.  Em then had to design her own contraption to allow her to go back and forth on the reel. She also ended up using coloured pens instead of paint as she could be more precise on the film and the colours were better. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor the initial previews Em took photos on her SLR through a magnify glass which she then collated in an editing programme to make a small preview quicktime. It was quite exhilarating seeing the first preview and watching the concept become tangible. If you look carefully we switch between 25fps and 12.5fps animation and live action at 25fps. As it would have been even more time consuming doing 25fps animation on all clips. But I think this really adds to the charm.  <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe had 3 rolls of negs for our animator. She only used one and what you see is the one master reel with painted frames. This reel of film is a work of art in it's own right. When the final animated clip was complete the final scan was a crucial step to seeing if it would all work. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFinally once re-scanned I was surprised by how well the colours came out. We then had minimal tweaking in the final grade for delivery. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nA huge thank you to everyone who believed and made this very unusual project happen.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSinead Harnett Credits<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDirector \u2013 Zaiba Jabbar<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nProduction Company -

The atmosphere full of stars, planets, clouds and fog emerges from huge colorful streams, forming balls and bubbles. Their surfaces reflect the background pattern, giving the objects  quite a three-dimensional look and feel. The space expands more and more into the depth, until upcoming star bursts make the whole system collapse. The illusion decomposes to a dark splash of substances and disappears as fast as it came up.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe areas you can see in this short film are only a few square centimeters in size, often less than a coin. The streams and interactions of fluids are not visible to the naked eye and have to be caught with a 1:1 macro lens and some very bright led lights.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt took me about 70 hours of shooting, trying and failing until I was able to capture pictures with an organic, non-generated character, establishing a truly reliable cosmos. The footage has only been edited, speedramped and color corrected, no composing or CGI. I hope you enjoy it. <br \/>\r\nThis video is entirely shot in 4K and then downscaled or cropped.

We're breaking that concept,\" says Ramos. -Chris Heller (Senior Associate Editor, The Atlantic Video)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is the first episode of RHYTHM IN MOTION, a series of short films about New York's subway musicians.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nwww.RhythmInMotion.nyc<br \/>\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RhythmInMotionNYC <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFlor de Toloache just released their new album: https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/mariachi-flor-de-toloache\/id956080850<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nABOUT THE SERIES<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDirected, produced, shot, and edited by Jenny Schweitzer<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe films were created in collaboration with the MTA\u2019s arts division, MTA Arts & Design, and in association with Killer Content (Still Alice, Alec Baldwin\u2019s Here\u2019s the Thing podcast) and Cinelan (FOCUS FORWARD Short Films, Big Ideas and WE THE ECONOMY 20 Short Films You Can\u2019t Afford To Miss).<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n...<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNew York City subway buskers are a well-documented bunch.   It is not unusual to witness a sea of iphones capturing those random performances as we scurry to our trains.  Since arriving in NYC in the late-90\u2019s, I, too, have marveled at them, mesmerized by this inimitable cast of characters. All the time, I have wondered what drove these performers underground.  For me, these musicians serve as an essential thread woven into the great culture that forms our vibrant city.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt was difficult to develop the first pieces. Having been approached by filmmakers on so many occasions, the musicians initially were skeptical of me. My objective in making these films was to give these gifted people the opportunity to reveal a hidden aspect of who they are and to voice their artistic message.   While the musicians' talent and performances serve as the framework for each film, for me, the allure lies beneath the music.  The films peek into their arresting and deeply personal stories.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 1987 the Metropolitan Transit Authority created Music Under New York to offer musicians access to coveted, high traffic spots in the subway system and to assure the commuters a high level of artistic accomplishment.  An annual, highly selective public audition in Grand Central Station invites newcomers to the roster.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMore than 350 individual performers participate in more than 7,500 performances throughout the transit system annually.    Rhythm in Motion profiles ten members from the Music Under New York roster.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFor me, collaborating with Music Under New York was a critical step in moving forward with the project.  It was deeply important that this vital organization value what my films could reveal about their network of musicians and this slice of NYC culture.  -Jenny Schweitzer","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/121802982","upload_date":"2015-03-10 12:56:39","mobile_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/121802982","thumbnail_small":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/514280677_100x75.webp","thumbnail_medium":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/514280677_200x150.webp","thumbnail_large":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/514280677_640.webp","user_id":3585257,"user_name":"Jenny Schweitzer","user_url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/jennyschweitzer","user_portrait_small":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_30x30.webp","user_portrait_medium":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_75x75.webp","user_portrait_large":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_100x100.webp","user_portrait_huge":"http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/portrait\/9253530_300x300.webp","stats_number_of_likes":322,"stats_number_of_plays":16693,"stats_number_of_comments":11,"duration":206,"width":1920,"height":1080,"tags":"mariachi, Rhythm in Motion, Jenny Schweitzer, Flor de Toloache, NYC, subway, New York City","embed_privacy":"anywhere"},{"id":126783354,"title":"Red Bull - Melodies for the Lemurs (Full Length)","description":"I was honored with a quite sweet award from the European skateboard community, the 'best film-maker of 2014'.

During this time, when most people put their bike to rest, an adventure between two Italian buddies began. <br \/>\r\nThey aimed to search for the COLD VEIN, that vein which come back to pulsate in the winter wilderness. <br \/>\r\nThis was an experience that brought Giorgio and Francesco to find more than what they were searching for. <br \/>\r\nA journey through their own limits, where what is important, is not the width of the tires but the extent of the horizons.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe video is dedicated to Walter Belli, a dear friend who had a bad injury during a DH session and who is still fighting every day with the wilderness alive in his heart.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSelf filmed with a Canon 500D (2009), a GoPro HERO4 and a \u201cno brand\u201d alluminum tripod. <br \/>\r\nAerial filming by APR Italia.
